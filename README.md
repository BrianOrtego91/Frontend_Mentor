# About Me

Good evening, My name is Brian Ortego, I am currently learning how to become a web developer. If you are intersted in following me on my journey you can check out my progress down below. Currently i'm working on completing Frontend Mentor projects to improve my skills and push to creating my very own portfolio website.

I work long hours in construction so I don't get to devote as much time as I would like to web developing so progress may be slow at times.
