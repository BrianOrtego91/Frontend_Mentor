## My Process

    I first declared my root variables for the colors and added the font face that was required. Then I laid out my html and wrapped everything in a class or id and used section's to divide the html into groups. I started working on the mobile layout first with css working from top down, after the mobile was complete I moved over to the desktop version using media querys.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Querys

### What I learned

I learned how to declare variables with the :root and how to use font face to include downloaded fonts. I also learned that it is alot easier to start with the mobile version first then moving to desktop version. I used mostly flexbox to design everything and I feel like I have a better grasp on it.

### Continued Development

I would like to continue learning more about css, and best way to get width and height under control. Also I want to start learning grid and use that to improve this site.

### Useful resources

    I would recommend having this up at all times I spent alot of time here.
